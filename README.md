## Homwork 5 GUI 1 - Summer Session 1, 2024
### Scrabble game
#### University of Massachusetts Loweel
#### Professor Zhou
#### Student: Patricia Antlitz

#### Disclaimer:

This code is not ready. Since the summer semester is shorter, I believe we were not exposed to these topic enough in order to learn it properly. However, a good portion of the code works:

##### Drag:

The user is able to drag the tile from the file rack to the game board

##### Drop:

The user is able to drop the tile on the board

##### Move

The user is able to move the tile around even after the tile was dropped

##### Count

The code add the numerical values of each letter in a word successfully/

##### Double letter

If the user places a letter on the double letter box, he will receive double points.


##### Resert, Submit, Get New Tiles

These buttons work as expected

##### Tables

both tables work, the first will show the word, if its valid, and how many points you got for that code. The second will show the total of all those word points added together, how many valid words used.

##### TIle placement:

I realized during testing that there are some spots within the board in which if I drop a tile there the program wont count it. Move the time slightly around to see it adds up

##### English dictionary:

The dictionary worked, I used Free Dictionary API https://dictionaryapi.dev/

### issues:
I was not able to make the "double word count" functionality work. 
The word label behaves strangedly sometimes. Some times it records the words as it should, some times it doesnt.
